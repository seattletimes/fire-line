As rain started to fall, Janet Millard was relieved: perhaps, she hoped, the massive fuelbreak planned for these woods, through big trees, critical spotted owl and fish habitat, wouldn’t be cut afterall. But she was mistaken. 

More than 20 miles long, and 300 feet wide, this fuelbreak was cut as an emergency fire supression tactic by the US Forest Service on public land with none of the usual environmental review.

* Trees that had stood for centuries were logged, including one so large it had to be hauled out by itself on an 18 wheeler
* More than 150 acres of spotted owl habitat were lost in one of the last best stands for the owl in all of Eastern Washington. Steel-tracked heavy equipment tore up riparian zones
* Fragile, erosive soils unique to the area were compacted. 

All to fight a fire that in the end never came anywhere near, and control an emergency that never happened.

Field notes, Emails, and other incident reports released by the Forest Service under a public records requested by the Seattle Times show employees working on the fire line knew there was no emergency. Some, like Millard, a wildlife biologist technician on the Wenatchee River Ranger District, tried to stop the cutting. But they were overruled and loggers cut a fuelbreak unprecedented in its scale in Oregon or Washington, eventually cutting more than 900 logging trucks worth trees, sold as salvage logs even though the Wolverine Fire never touched the forest.

Building the fuelbreak poured money into the pockets of loggers, dozer drivers, log truck drivers, and heavy equipment operators locally and all over the region during a time when their equipment would have been idled, and the woods shut down to logging because of fire risk, notes Katie Jones, president of Mark Jones Trucking Inc. in Roseburg Oregon, just one of dozens of contractors that worked on the Wolverine. 

The rags to riches of fire fighting can be dramatic: one mechanic’s assistant usually paid $12.50 an hour at their trucking company garage suddenly was earning more than triple those wages, at $350 a day, plus overtime. 

“And that is when normally he’d have to collect unemployment,” Jones said, “because the woods are shut down.” 

Building the line also realized a wish long held by local fire officials. 

“We were tickled pink to have it put in,” said Mike Lamar, local fire chief for the volunteer Lake Wenatchee fire department. Lamar said he had long wanted a fuelbreak cut as a preventative measure, but could never get the money or permits to do it.

“I don’t think this project ever would have been done at this scale if we had not had the impending threat of the Wolverine fire,” Lamar said. “ It is the bureaucracy, and the people who don’t live in the woods telling people who do how it ought to be.

“There’s times when our local forest service (district) is handcuffed by the bureaucracy at higher levels. We were excited, it was on such a large scale.”

To be sure, the Wolverine Fire, started by lightening on June 29 in the Lake Chelan National Recreation Area, looked threatening when the decision to cut the line was made last August. By then, the fire was moving fast, and making runs of as much as two miles a day. Washington was burning its way to a historic fire season. The entire nation was on a Level 5 wildfire alert -- the highest. Computer models showed a 40 percent chance of fire entering the Chiwawa Drainage, which fire managers judged would be rugged and hard to defend, putting the nearby communities of Plain and Entiat, Chelan County, at risk. 

Worse, three forest service fire fighters had lost their lives August 19 in the Twisp River fires. 

“All of this stuff was swirling around at the same time, we are notifying families about the deaths of their loved ones, we were planning a memorial service for those fire fighters, and we are monitoring the progress of the Wolverine Fire and at that time very guarded,” said Mike Williams, supervisor for the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, where the fuel break was cut through the Wenatchee River and Entiat Districts. “I can’t underscore enough that all this stuff was going on at the same time as this contingency line decision, it just adds to the context of what was going on. We don’t know what was going to happen, but what we are going to do is continue to try to minimize the exposure of our fire fighters and protect life and property.”

Firebreaks such as this one are not new to Washington, or the Northwest. But the scale of this cut was unprecedented in Washington. The Forest Service sold the logs by competitive bid for nearly $770,000, to Boise Cascade Wood Products in La Grande, Oregon, and Sierra Pacific Industries of Mount Vernon, Washington. Proceeds from the sale are divided between the national, regional, and district office of the forest service. The sale counts on the books in 2016, the first time since 2011 the Okanogan-Wenatchee would meet its timber target in a forest starved, because of environmental restrictions, for logs.

Promised in a flyer created by the Forest Service for public outreach was a so-called shaded fuelbreak in the woods. Not a clear cut, but billed as a selective cut, that would leave the big trees of fire resistent species such as ponderosa pine and take trees smaller than 20 inches in diameter, leaving a “park-like area.” The idea was to reduce fuel for wildfire, and give fire fighters an anchor point from which to safely work, should the fire come over the Entiat ridge into the Chiwawa drainage, near Lake Wenatchee.

The line was cut along the Meadow Creek Road from its northern end near Twin Lakes, crossing the Chiwawa River at Meadow Creek and continuing along the Chiwawa Ridge and the 5200 road near Sugarloaf lookout to the Entiat Valley to the south, logging about 700 acres, including more than 150 acres of spotted owl habitat, including six acres in so-called owl circles around nesting areas

Crews were supposed to do only hand work within 100 feet of streams, and leave trees larger than 20 inches in diameter standing, forest service documents show. But it didn’t always go that way.

Photographs obtained under a public records request by the Seattle Times show logs cut that were so big, an 18-wheeler could carry only a few at time, and in the case of one grand old tree, only one massive log. So many trees were cut, the piles of logs stacked for sale towered more than three stories high, and covered acres. Many logs were 30 inches across at the base, and bigger.

Even as it was underway, the cut was controversial. 

Millard usually surveys owl habitat in the Wenatchee River Ranger District. She was tasked with working as a resource advisor during the cut, to help minimize ecological damage. 

Millard’s field notes, kept by all employees to track their time and work, shows it started to rain while she was doing her initial survey of the proposed areas of the line. So at a planning meeting Aug. 30, she expressed her surprise to learn the line was still going forward. Models showed probability of the fire moving into the area had dropped to four percent or less, and the scored index of fire risk was low. Other districts in the forest were being reopened to visitors, Millard noted. But she was shouted down by her immediate supervisor, Jeff Rivera, the district ranger on the Wenatchee River Ranger District. “We were told this line is happening and we are to accept it,” she reported in her notes. 

Her response was to make a sign and staple it to her shirt. It said: “Resource Advisor = Passive Observer to the Carnage,” according to her field notes. 

Rivera told her to remove the sign. “My response was that I need to remove myself from the office and I did so,” Millard wrote to her supervisors Sept. 1 in an e-mail. “I am trying to do my job as a public servant and to be a responsible steward of the public’s resources...I feel like my concerns and input were not welcome.

“I told the Ranger that constructing this... felt like an end-run around NEPA (the National Environmental Policy Act) and I forgot to mention the ESA (Endangered Species Act.)”

Controversy over the fuelbreak being cut even as the emergency faded was reflected in a struggle by forest service and fire fighter personnel to decide just what to call it. After distribution of a public information flyer that described the fuelbreak as a community protection line -- a fire defense tactic planned and built with the usual environmental permits and public input -- Susan Peterson, a public information officer for the forest service at the time, pulled the flyers and sent out an Email correcting staff in the district. “This line is and will be referred to as a fire contingency line to prevent fire from spreading to down valley communities,” she wrote. “Thanks for sharing Susan,” Cindy Raekes, a fisheries biologist working at the time as a resource advisor on the line wrote back. “The next problem will be defining how Lake Wenatchee and Plain are at risk from this fire.”

As work on the line progressed, Raekes wrote her supervisors about her concern at the damage she was witnessing.

“In some instances I felt like I was able to provide timely advice to minimize resource damage,” Raekes wrote. “But in most cases what I observed was an operation in progress without a plan to minimize resource damage...this is essentially a 727-acre ground-based timber sale without any best management practices to minimize resource impacts.”

Don Youkey, a biologist for the district, was charged with managing the oversight of the cut by resource advisors. But at times he couldn’t even keep track of the action.

“It’s getting a little out of control out here,” Youkey wrote in an Email Friday September 4, 2015 to his supervisors and resource advisors. “Any help is appreciated, I’m a little over my head on the logging operation. And several things planned have not been pulled off as described...impacts keep accumulating with another landing needed here, another there, when originally told most decking would be on the road, and about half as many as are being constructed...and time line several times longer than original estimate. And double the equipment.”

Lauri Malmquist, a botanist with the Wenatchee River Ranger District, wrote him back in a silent Email scream: “Why don’t we STOP and THINK and PLAN?! There is NO emergency.”

Jeff Krupka, wildlife biologist at the US Fish and Wildlife Service office in Wenatchee also worked as a resource advisor on the cut. Not only was the cut unlike anything that would be allowed on these lands under normal circumstances, but even as an emergency measure, it wasn’t carried out as promised, Krupka said, because of the large amount of heavy equipment involved and urgent pace of the work.

“We went back and had to re-flag all this stuff where the damage was already done, there was not much you could do,” Krupka said. He watched a feller buncher roll through a riparian reserve of a creek with protected fish who didn’t even know it until the steel tracks of his rig got wet. 

In a standard, regulated, planned timber sale, skid trails for dragging out logs are designated, to minimize compaction and damage to soils. But instead, “Equipment operators just ran all over the place,” Krupka said. “It was a free for all. 

“They were moving a lot faster than we could keep up, and often we felt like we were in reactive mode, by the time you got there to check out a unit, there was really nothing more you could do other than identify rehabilitation needs.”

With so many trees cut, loggers generated ton upon ton of slash -- limbs and other logging debris --that created problems of their own. “They were monster piles that got so big they would run cats over them to compact it down,” Krupka said. And instead of leaving the promised “park- like area,” mountains of slash too big to chip, haul or burn still litter the landscape on some areas of the fuelbreak, in piles bigger than a garage. Fragile volcanic soils were compacted by heavy equipment and remain vulnerable to erosion.

Along one stretch of the line, big trees were cut with heavy equipment and stacked in five landings, one every half mile, on sensitive soils near streams.

Some of the landscape cut and streams affected were critical habitat to listed species, including bull trout, and the spotted owl. “This was one of the big three areas that are essentially carrying the largest burden for conservation of the owl in all of Eastern Washington,” Krupka said.

Youkey later said in a phone interview he was struggling to keep up with as many as ten feller bunchers working at once. “We haven’t used feller bunches to this extent perhaps anywhere and certainly not on this forest, we have never had anywhere near ten, typically we would do this kind of work by hand and it is slow.” 

The scale of the operation was bigger than expected or than could be managed. 

“The landings grew larger than anticipated,” Youkey said in an interview. “The volume (of logs.) The Size. The amount of material coming out was just greater than anyone anticipated and the numbers of acres we needed just to deck that stuff. The slash and branches were the largest challenge, we never did solve that.” 

Yet as loggers worked feverishly, the fire never came anywhere near. The closest edge of the Wolverine Fire remained 8 air miles away. Cutting began in the heaviest timber, furthest from the closest risk. Incident Status Summary forms filed by fire managers indicate that on 13 out of 14 days between August 30, as loggers and heavy equipment operators marshalled to start cutting, and the day the last trees fell, fire behavior was described as minimal, creeping and smoldering by fire managers. Every day during the same period that life, safety and health threats were rated by managers the situation in the vicinity of the line was rated as no threat, or possible future threat from the fire. Weather was often unseasonably cool, rainy, or both.

In complex fires, local forest service managers delegate authority to the incident management team, which will typically, as it did in this case, include fire fighters from all over the region, country and even the world, in addition to loggers, log truck drivers and other timber cutting crew members.

Clay Templin, from the Tonto National Forest in Arizona, was the incident commander in charge when the decision to launch the cut was made. He has since been promoted to director of fire and aviation management for the US Forest Service in the Midwest and Northeast. “This was my 38th fire season, and I have been doing national stuff for better than 20 years, and made these decisions based on that experience,” Templin said.

“We were looking at where are we going to be most successful if we are going to have to make a stand.” He stood by the decision to begin and continue the cut even as weather conditions and fire behavior significantly changed. 

“There is always a lot of armchair quarterbacking that goes on, people question all the things that we do,” Templin said. 

“I am looking at it not only given what we are facing, but what I know to be past (fire) behavior, and the history of chronic drought. We are facing extraordinary conditions. That whole area around Okanogan-Wenatchee, you can have stuff where you think you have a season-ending (weather) event and you don’t. That country can come back. You can get another fire season, you get dry winds and that country can go right back to burning again.”

Also a factor was how to stop cutting the line once it was started. 

“When we ended up having a change in the weather and things moderated, we looked for where we could tie it off and feel pretty secure,” Templin said. 

Fire risk ratings remained low nearly every day of the emergency logging operation but for the weekend of September 12. 

Based on a worst case modeling scenario on September 9 that showed possible fire growth to within three miles of the line, Nathan Rabe of the Kennewick Fire Department, who had taken over from Templin, made the decision to keep cutting the line. But by the 14th, conditions moderated again. Rabe gave the order to stop cutting trees.

Repairing damage from the logging, from crushed culverts to compacted soils, and dealing with mountains of mulch and slash, in addition to hauling timber for sale, would take weeks more. Some of the work would have to wait until the next year; slash piles were just too big to chip or haul and would have to cure for burning. 

Long after the last log truck rumbled out of the valley, controversy over the cut remains.

“Here it is miles from the fire, in a different drainage. It makes no sense,” said Rich Haydon, a retired forest service wilderness ranger, who lives near the fuelbreak. “And you look at the size of the trees. It doesn’t make any sense in terms of fire fighting, or even what we would do for a timber sale in this day and age. You can’t justify it.” 

But far from criticizing the fuelbreak, Lamar said he only wished the loggers, stopped when about 90 percent of the fuelbreak had been cut -- had finished. 

His biggest concern now is whether the forest service will continue to maintain the cut areas into the future so they don’t grow back -- maintenance which, unlike the original cut, must first pass a permit review, and be funded in the forest’s routine maintenance budget. 

“It will be some college folks who will come out and look at it with a lot of degrees and fill lots of paper,” Lamar said. “This emergency declaration allowed us to do this, on an emergency basis. We didn’t need to do all that.” 

He defended the line as less damaging to the forest and local community than a fire would have been. “Nobody wants a vacation home on a blacked out hillside.”
