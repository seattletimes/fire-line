Controversy is reflected even in a struggle by the forest service and firefighters to decide just what to call the line.

A public-information flier described it as a community-protection line â€” a fire defense tactic planned and built with the usual environmental permits and public input. Then Susan Peterson, a public-information officer for the forest service at the time, pulled the fliers and sent an email correcting staff in the district.

"This line is and will be referred to as a fire contingency line to prevent fire from spreading to down valley communities," she wrote.

"Thanks for sharing Susan. The next problem," Raekes wrote sarcastically, "will be defining how Lake Wenatchee and Plain are at risk from this fire."

Jeff Krupka, wildlife biologist at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service office in Wenatchee, also worked as an adviser on the cut. He said in an interview that, even as an emergency measure, the line wasn't carried out as promised because of the large amount of heavy equipment involved and urgent pace of the work.

He said trees larger than allowed were cut, streamside buffers were ignored and "equipment operators just ran all over the place" compacting soils. "It was a free-for-all."

Rather than guiding the work, "there was really nothing more you could do other than identify rehabilitation needs," Krupka said.

Don Youkey, a forest-service biologist for the district, echoed those complaints in a Sept. 4 email to his supervisors and resource advisers.

"It's getting a little out of control here," he wrote.

Lauri Malmquist, a botanist with the Wenatchee River Ranger District, wrote him back: "Why don't we STOP and THINK and PLAN?! There is NO emergency."
