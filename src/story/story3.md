Even as it was underway, the cut was controversial. 

Millard usually surveys owl habitat in the Wenatchee River Ranger District. She was tasked with working as a resource advisor during the cut, to help minimize ecological damage. 

Millard’s field notes, kept by all employees to track their time and work, shows it started to rain while she was doing her initial survey of the proposed areas of the line. So at a planning meeting Aug. 30, she expressed her surprise to learn the line was still going forward. Models showed probability of the fire moving into the area had dropped to four percent or less, and the scored index of fire risk was low. Other districts in the forest were being reopened to visitors, Millard noted. But she was shouted down by her immediate supervisor, Jeff Rivera, the district ranger on the Wenatchee River Ranger District. “We were told this line is happening and we are to accept it,” she reported in her notes. 

Her response was to make a sign and staple it to her shirt. It said: “Resource Advisor = Passive Observer to the Carnage,” according to her field notes. 

Rivera told her to remove the sign. “My response was that I need to remove myself from the office and I did so,” Millard wrote to her supervisors Sept. 1 in an e-mail. “I am trying to do my job as a public servant and to be a responsible steward of the public’s resources...I feel like my concerns and input were not welcome.

“I told the Ranger that constructing this... felt like an end-run around NEPA (the National Environmental Policy Act) and I forgot to mention the ESA (Endangered Species Act.)”

Controversy over the fuelbreak being cut even as the emergency faded was reflected in a struggle by forest service and fire fighter personnel to decide just what to call it. After distribution of a public information flyer that described the fuelbreak as a community protection line -- a fire defense tactic planned and built with the usual environmental permits and public input -- Susan Peterson, a public information officer for the forest service at the time, pulled the flyers and sent out an Email correcting staff in the district. “This line is and will be referred to as a fire contingency line to prevent fire from spreading to down valley communities,” she wrote. “Thanks for sharing Susan,” Cindy Raekes, a fisheries biologist working at the time as a resource advisor on the line wrote back. “The next problem will be defining how Lake Wenatchee and Plain are at risk from this fire.”

As work on the line progressed, Raekes wrote her supervisors about her concern at the damage she was witnessing.

“In some instances I felt like I was able to provide timely advice to minimize resource damage,” Raekes wrote. “But in most cases what I observed was an operation in progress without a plan to minimize resource damage...this is essentially a 727-acre ground-based timber sale without any best management practices to minimize resource impacts.”

Don Youkey, a biologist for the district, was charged with managing the oversight of the cut by resource advisors. But at times he couldn’t even keep track of the action.

“It’s getting a little out of control out here,” Youkey wrote in an Email Friday September 4, 2015 to his supervisors and resource advisors. “Any help is appreciated, I’m a little over my head on the logging operation. And several things planned have not been pulled off as described...impacts keep accumulating with another landing needed here, another there, when originally told most decking would be on the road, and about half as many as are being constructed...and time line several times longer than original estimate. And double the equipment.”

Lauri Malmquist, a botanist with the Wenatchee River Ranger District, wrote him back in a silent Email scream: “Why don’t we STOP and THINK and PLAN?! There is NO emergency.”
