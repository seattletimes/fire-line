## Controversial choice

Even as it was under way, this fire line was controversial. 

Millard, a Forest Service wildlife biological technician, usually surveys owl habitat in the Wenatchee River Ranger District. She was tasked with advising during the cut to help minimize destruction.

Millard’s field notes, kept by all employees to track their time and work, shows it started to rain while she was doing her initial survey of the proposed line areas. So at a meeting Aug. 29 she expressed her surprise to learn the line was still going forward. Models showed probability of the fire moving into the area had dropped to 4 percent or less. Other districts in the forest were being reopened to visitors, Millard noted.

But she was shouted down by one of her supervisors, Jeff Rivera, the district ranger on the Wenatchee River Ranger District. “We were told this line is happening and we are to accept it,” she reported in her notes. 

In response, she made a sign and stapled it to her shirt. It said: “Resource Advisor = Passive Observer to the Carnage,” according to her notes. 

Rivera told her to remove the sign. “My response was that I need to remove myself from the office and I did so,” Millard wrote in a Sept. 1 email to her supervisors. “I am trying to do my job as a public servant and to be a responsible steward of the public’s resources ... I feel like my concerns and input were not welcome.”

She wrote that the fire line now felt like an end-run around laws protecting the environment and endangered species.
