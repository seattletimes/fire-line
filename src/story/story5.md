## "Extraordinary conditions"

In complex fires, locals delegate authority to a management team, often drawn from all over the country. 

Clay Templin, from the Tonto National Forest in Arizona, was the incident commander in charge when the decision to launch the cut was made. He has since been promoted to director of fire and aviation management for the U.S. Forest Service in the Midwest and Northeast. 

"We were looking at where are we going to be most successful if we are going to have to make a stand," Templin said in an interview.

He stood by the decision to begin and continue the cut as weather conditions and fire behavior significantly changed. Cooler, rainy weather quieted the fire to creeping and smoldering, even as work on the line was at its most feverish. Risk of the fire spreading to the area of the line as it was being cut dropped to 1 percent or less in computer models. 

"I am looking at it not only given what we are facing, but what I know to be past behavior, and the history of chronic drought," Templin said. "We are facing extraordinary conditions. That whole area around Okanogan-Wenatchee, you can have stuff where you think you have a season-ending (weather) event and you don't ... you get dry winds and that country can go right back to burning again."
