Along one stretch of the line, big trees were cut with heavy equipment and stacked in five landings, one every half mile, on sensitive soils near streams.

Some of the landscape cut and streams affected were critical habitat to listed species, including bull trout, and the spotted owl. “This was one of the big three areas that are essentially carrying the largest burden for conservation of the owl in all of Eastern Washington,” Krupka said.

Youkey later said in a phone interview he was struggling to keep up with as many as ten feller bunchers working at once. “We haven’t used feller bunches to this extent perhaps anywhere and certainly not on this forest, we have never had anywhere near ten, typically we would do this kind of work by hand and it is slow.” 

The scale of the operation was bigger than expected or than could be managed. 

“The landings grew larger than anticipated,” Youkey said in an interview. “The volume (of logs.) The Size. The amount of material coming out was just greater than anyone anticipated and the numbers of acres we needed just to deck that stuff. The slash and branches were the largest challenge, we never did solve that.” 

Yet as loggers worked feverishly, the fire never came anywhere near. The closest edge of the Wolverine Fire remained 8 air miles away. Cutting began in the heaviest timber, furthest from the closest risk. Incident Status Summary forms filed by fire managers indicate that on 13 out of 14 days between August 30, as loggers and heavy equipment operators marshalled to start cutting, and the day the last trees fell, fire behavior was described as minimal, creeping and smoldering by fire managers. Every day during the same period that life, safety and health threats were rated by managers the situation in the vicinity of the line was rated as no threat, or possible future threat from the fire. Weather was often unseasonably cool, rainy, or both.
