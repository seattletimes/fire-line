Managers also are reluctant to pass on deploying resources in a busy fire season, holding them for later, because by then they may be in use elsewhere, and no longer available if the fire blew up.”

“When we ended up having a change in the weather and things moderated, we looked for where we could tie it off and feel pretty secure,” Templin said. 

Jonathan Thompson, senior ecologist at the Harvard Forest in Petersham, Mass., once worked as a firefighter, and is studying the Biscuit Fire, Oregon’s largest. 

“You might get a question if you screw it up one way,” he explained, “but if you screw it up the other way and burn down houses, or lose firefighters, then what? It’s ‘Why didn’t you put in that contingency line.’ ”

A lot of people get mad, he said, about “the big strips they cut, and just run bulldozers through, but every incentive is there for them to do that ... You use the fire model and if it says only a 1 in 100 event, you probably would still do it.”

Repairing damage from the logging — from crushed culverts to compacted soils — and dealing with mountains of mulch and slash, in addition to hauling timber for sale, would take weeks more. Some of the work would have to wait; slash piles big as a house were just too big to chip or haul and are still there. 

Lamar said he only wished the loggers, who stopped when about 90 percent of the line had been cut, had finished. 

His biggest concern now is whether the Forest Service will continue to maintain the cut areas into the future so they don’t grow back — maintenance which, unlike the original emergency cut, must first pass a permit review, and be funded in the forest’s routine budget. 

“It will be some college folks who will come out and look at it with a lot of degrees and fill lots of paper,” Lamar said. “This emergency declaration allowed us to do this.” 

He defended the line as less damaging to the forest and local community than a fire would have been. “Nobody wants a vacation home on a blacked-out hillside.”
