In complex fires, local forest service managers delegate authority to the incident management team, which will typically, as it did in this case, include fire fighters from all over the region, country and even the world, in addition to loggers, log truck drivers and other timber cutting crew members.

Clay Templin, from the Tonto National Forest in Arizona, was the incident commander in charge when the decision to launch the cut was made. He has since been promoted to director of fire and aviation management for the US Forest Service in the Midwest and Northeast. “This was my 38th fire season, and I have been doing national stuff for better than 20 years, and made these decisions based on that experience,” Templin said.

“We were looking at where are we going to be most successful if we are going to have to make a stand.” He stood by the decision to begin and continue the cut even as weather conditions and fire behavior significantly changed. 

“There is always a lot of armchair quarterbacking that goes on, people question all the things that we do,” Templin said. 

“I am looking at it not only given what we are facing, but what I know to be past (fire) behavior, and the history of chronic drought. We are facing extraordinary conditions. That whole area around Okanogan-Wenatchee, you can have stuff where you think you have a season-ending (weather) event and you don’t. That country can come back. You can get another fire season, you get dry winds and that country can go right back to burning again.”

Also a factor was how to stop cutting the line once it was started. 

“When we ended up having a change in the weather and things moderated, we looked for where we could tie it off and feel pretty secure,” Templin said. 

Fire risk ratings remained low nearly every day of the emergency logging operation but for the weekend of September 12. 

Based on a worst case modeling scenario on September 9 that showed possible fire growth to within three miles of the line, Nathan Rabe of the Kennewick Fire Department, who had taken over from Templin, made the decision to keep cutting the line. But by the 14th, conditions moderated again. Rabe gave the order to stop cutting trees.

Repairing damage from the logging, from crushed culverts to compacted soils, and dealing with mountains of mulch and slash, in addition to hauling timber for sale, would take weeks more. Some of the work would have to wait until the next year; slash piles were just too big to chip or haul and would have to cure for burning.

Long after the last log truck rumbled out of the valley, controversy over the cut remains.

“Here it is miles from the fire, in a different drainage. It makes no sense,” said Rich Haydon, a retired forest service wilderness ranger, who lives near the fuelbreak. “And you look at the size of the trees. It doesn’t make any sense in terms of fire fighting, or even what we would do for a timber sale in this day and age. You can’t justify it.” 

But far from criticizing the fuelbreak, Lamar said he only wished the loggers, stopped when about 90 percent of the fuelbreak had been cut -- had finished. 

His biggest concern now is whether the forest service will continue to maintain the cut areas into the future so they don’t grow back -- maintenance which, unlike the original cut, must first pass a permit review, and be funded in the forest’s routine maintenance budget. 

“It will be some college folks who will come out and look at it with a lot of degrees and fill lots of paper,” Lamar said. “This emergency declaration allowed us to do this, on an emergency basis. We didn’t need to do all that.” 

He defended the line as less damaging to the forest and local community than a fire would have been. “Nobody wants a vacation home on a blacked out hillside.”
