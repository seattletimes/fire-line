As rain started to fall, Janet Millard was relieved: perhaps, she hoped, the massive fuelbreak planned for these woods, through big trees, critical spotted owl and fish habitat, wouldn’t be cut afterall. But she was mistaken. 

More than 20 miles long, and 300 feet wide, this fuelbreak was cut as an emergency fire supression tactic by the US Forest Service on public land with none of the usual environmental review.

* Trees that had stood for centuries were logged, including one so large it had to be hauled out by itself on an 18 wheeler
* More than 150 acres of spotted owl habitat were lost in one of the last best stands for the owl in all of Eastern Washington. Steel-tracked heavy equipment tore up riparian zones
* Fragile, erosive soils unique to the area were compacted. 

All to fight a fire that in the end never came anywhere near, and control an emergency that never happened.

Field notes, Emails, and other incident reports released by the Forest Service under a public records requested by the Seattle Times show employees working on the fire line knew there was no emergency. Some, like Millard, a wildlife biologist technician on the Wenatchee River Ranger District, tried to stop the cutting. But they were overruled and loggers cut a fuelbreak unprecedented in its scale in Oregon or Washington, eventually cutting more than 900 logging trucks worth trees, sold as salvage logs even though the Wolverine Fire never touched the forest.

Building the fuelbreak poured money into the pockets of loggers, dozer drivers, log truck drivers, and heavy equipment operators locally and all over the region during a time when their equipment would have been idled, and the woods shut down to logging because of fire risk, notes Katie Jones, president of Mark Jones Trucking Inc. in Roseburg Oregon, just one of dozens of contractors that worked on the Wolverine. 

The rags to riches of fire fighting can be dramatic: one mechanic’s assistant usually paid $12.50 an hour at their trucking company garage suddenly was earning more than triple those wages, at $350 a day, plus overtime. 

“And that is when normally he’d have to collect unemployment,” Jones said, “because the woods are shut down.” 

Building the line also realized a wish long held by local fire officials. 

“We were tickled pink to have it put in,” said Mike Lamar, local fire chief for the volunteer Lake Wenatchee fire department. Lamar said he had long wanted a fuelbreak cut as a preventative measure, but could never get the money or permits to do it.

“I don’t think this project ever would have been done at this scale if we had not had the impending threat of the Wolverine fire,” Lamar said. “ It is the bureaucracy, and the people who don’t live in the woods telling people who do how it ought to be.

“There’s times when our local forest service (district) is handcuffed by the bureaucracy at higher levels. We were excited, it was on such a large scale.”
