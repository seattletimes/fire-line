As rain started to fall, Janet Millard thought the fire line planned for these woods, through big trees and critical wildlife habitat, wouldn't be cut after all. But the U.S. Forest Service wildlife biological technician was mistaken. 

Trees that had stood for centuries were felled, including one so large it was a one-log load on a semi truck. More than 114 acres of critical spotted-owl habitat were destroyed. Steel-tracked heavy equipment tore up fragile ground along streams. Erosive soils unique to the area were bulldozed. 

The fire break, one of the largest ever cut in Washington, was cut by the U.S. Forest Service in the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest with none of the usual environmental review. It stretched up to 300 feet wide for more than 50 miles, from the Entiat drainage on the east to Twin Lakes to the west.

The Wolverine Fire looked threatening when the decision to cut the line was first made last August. By then, the fire was moving fast, and making runs of as much as two miles a day during Washington's historic and deadly fire season. Fire lines are intended to slow the advance of a blaze, and give crews time and safer space to work.

But field notes, emails and documents released by the Forest Service under a Freedom of Information Act request by The Seattle Times show Forest Service employees working on the fire break believed there was no emergency by the time the logging began about two weeks later. 

Ultimately, they were right â€” the Wolverine Fire never came anywhere near the Chiwawa watershed that fire managers deemed was at risk.

Still, loggers over about two weeks cut more than 930 truckloads of trees from three forest-service districts. The timber was later sold as salvage logs, with $769,933 going to the Forest Service. 

"We were tickled pink to have it put in," said Mick Lamar, fire chief for the volunteer Lake Wenatchee fire department. The community's wildfire-protection plan had since 2007 called for strategic fuel breaks, and Lamar said he had long wanted a fire line cut as a preventive measure but could never get the money or permits to do it. 

The fire burning at least 8 miles away changed all that: the perceived emergency lifted any need for environmental permits, and opened a federal spigot of money. 

"I don't think this project ever would have been done at this scale if we had not had the impending threat of the Wolverine Fire," Lamar said. "It is the bureaucracy, and the people who don't live in the woods telling people who do how it ought to be."
