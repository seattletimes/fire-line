## Life, property, then nature

The Wolverine Fire, started by lightning on June 29 in the Lake Chelan National Recreation Area, was part of Washington's historic fire season last summer and burned 65,512 acres, nearly all of them under Forest Service stewardship. 

Computer models in late August showed the fire had up to a 40 percent chance of burning into the Chiwawa Drainage, which fire managers judged put nearby communities at risk. 

Worse, three forest-service firefighters had been killed the week before in the Twisp River fire. A fourth is still recovering from terrible burns. 

"All of this stuff was swirling around at the same time, we are notifying families about the deaths of their loved ones, we were planning a memorial service for those firefighters, and we are monitoring the progress of the Wolverine Fire and at that time very guarded," said Mike Williams, supervisor for the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, where the fuel break was cut. 

While unusually large, the contingency line is part of a familiar arsenal of aggressive firefighting tactics, as wildfires grow bigger due to decades of fire suppression, and climate change. 

Meanwhile people keep building more vacation homes in the woods, and prescribed burns and planned community protection lines go begging for money or political support. 

Then the next fire breaks out, and the cycle repeats, as firefighters protect, as official forest-service policy, life, property and natural resources â€” in that order, with mixed results. Nature bats last, and in more ways than one.
