Promised in a flyer created by the Forest Service for public outreach was a so-called shaded fuelbreak in the woods. Not a clear cut, but billed as a selective cut, that would leave the big trees of fire resistent species such as ponderosa pine and take trees smaller than 20 inches in diameter, leaving a “park-like area.” The idea was to reduce fuel for wildfire, and give fire fighters an anchor point from which to safely work, should the fire come over the Entiat ridge into the Chiwawa drainage, near Lake Wenatchee.

The line was cut along the Meadow Creek Road from its northern end near Twin Lakes, crossing the Chiwawa River at Meadow Creek and continuing along the Chiwawa Ridge and the 5200 road near Sugarloaf lookout to the Entiat Valley to the south, logging about 700 acres, including more than 150 acres of spotted owl habitat, including six acres in so-called owl circles around nesting areas

Crews were supposed to do only hand work within 100 feet of streams, and leave trees larger than 20 inches in diameter standing, forest service documents show. But it didn’t always go that way.

Photographs obtained under a public records request by the Seattle Times show logs cut that were so big, an 18-wheeler could carry only a few at time, and in the case of one grand old tree, only one massive log. So many trees were cut, the piles of logs stacked for sale towered more than three stories high, and covered acres. Many logs were 30 inches across at the base, and bigger.
