Building the contingency line — so called because it is a fire line constructed to defend against a worst-case scenario — also meant work at 50 percent or better than usual pay for crews and equipment that would have otherwise been idled, because logging was shut down due to fire risk.

Bret Daugherty, of Ellensburg, one of the biggest operators on the fire break, rolled out 26 pieces of heavy equipment including nine log trucks and three mechanical tree cutters, called feller bunchers.

Public contracting records show just one of his feller bunchers earned a $3,650 daily rate, plus at least $1,800 a day in mileage — with the money paid whether the equipment was put to work or not once called to the scene. The total cost of fighting the Wolverine Fire was more than $31 million; the Forest Service did not break out the cost of the contingency line construction.

“It’s a total win-win and the local district is generating revenue with the timber sale. They get some money they can put back on the ground; it’s great,” Daugherty said.

The Forest Service had promised a so-called shaded fuelbreak. Not a clear cut, but a thinning intended to leave the big trees of fire-resistant species such as ponderosa pine, and take trees smaller than 20 inches in diameter, leaving a “parklike area.” 

The idea was to reduce fuel for wildfire, and give firefighters an anchor point from which to safely work, should the fire come over the Entiat ridge into the Chiwawa drainage, near Lake Wenatchee.

Most controversial was more than 10 linear miles and 237 acres cut mainly through heavy forest on the western side of Sugarloaf Mountain in the Wenatchee River Ranger District. That portion of the line was farthest from the fire risk — and did the most environmental damage, with about half of it logged in nesting, roosting and foraging habitat in one of the last best stands for the spotted owl in all of Eastern Washington.
